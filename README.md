# Wagic Deck Builder

This is a Magic the Gathering deck builder tool for Wololo's [Wagic](https://github.com/WagicProject/wagic) a homebrew MTG game. The decks are plain text and can also be used for personal archival means.

## Prerequisits

 - [Wagic](https://github.com/WagicProject/wagic): Have this installed somewhere locally on the computer you run this program on. It requires some files to check things not handled by API calls
 - [Python 3.^](https://www.python.org/): At least python 3, although not tested for any specific release
 - [MTGSDK](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/#documentationsdks) for Python: A wrapper of the API calls


## Operations

Currently being worked on

## Troubleshooting

 - Use on Windows. For your on use, you can change the Wagic directory line to wherever you saved it. (ie 'C:\Users\YourName\Downloads'). The os.environ isn't strictly linux, but less likely to work out of the box.
